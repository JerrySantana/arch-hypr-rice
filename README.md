## 🌀 About This Repo

Here are my config files from my <strong> Hyprland</strong> ***rice*** 🍚 on <strong>󰣇 Arch Linux</strong> (**obviously!** ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯).

This setup includes:

- 🖥️ Media scripts (notifications, play/pause/next)
- 📴 Power scripts (shutdown, restart, logoff, sleep — for Waybar)
- 🗃️ The dot files

> **Note:** I'm no scripting master, so bear with me... there’s <big>***a lot***</big> of room for improvement 🫡.

This is my first attempt at customizing Hyprland and Arch Linux on my own, and honestly...

## 📚 How It Was Made

Most configurations are based on:

- 📖 Documentation ([Hyprland](https://wiki.hypr.land/), [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/), [mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako/wiki), [walker](https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/wiki), [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki), [Waypaper](https://anufrievroman.gitbook.io/waypaper))
- 🧠 [Hyprland Wiki — Example Configs](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Example-configurations/), [Starship themes](https://github.com/starship/starship)

I’ve added comments and links inside the config files to help others (especially beginners) get started in the **rice-ing world** (👀 did you catch that pun? 😎).
